# Mount Lafayette Hike

*October 5th, 2019*

Mount Lafayette is a five thousand footer in the Franconia Range of the White Mountains.  This mountain is known to have some of the greatest views in the White Mountains for good reasons.  With it's tree-less, 360 degree field of view at the top, the surrounding landscapes look beautiful.  Especially on a clear sunny day.  Lucky for us, the weather on this day was perfect for a hike.  Visibility was clear for miles and clouds were few and far between.

We began our journey on Falling Waters trail.  There was a beautiful looking waterful that ran down most of the trail.  It made for some excellent picture taking spots.  There were plenty of spots on this trail to take a good instagram or facebook picture.  Towards the summit, it was cold enough where the water was freezing over, which made some hikers fall on the slippery rocks.

Without a doubt, the greatest part of this hike starts when you approach the tree line.  At five thousand feet, the trees stop growing, and all that is left is small brush.  This gives you an unobstructed view of the surrounding landscape.  Doing this hike on a clear day will give you memorable views.  The Falling Waters trail will bring you up to the summit of Little Haystack Mountain.  From there, you take a path that brings you over a ridge to the top of Mount Lincoln.  Then the path will lead you to biggest summit in the ridge trail, Mount Lafayette.

The wind at the top of the mountain was about 30mph.  If it was that windy at Mount Lafayette, it must have been terribly windy at Mount Washington.  The wind was chilling, and me being the genius that I am, forgot to bring gloves on the trip.  I had my hands in my coat pocket the entire time on the ridge summit trail.  It was so cold that was frost and snow dusted the top of the mountains.  Snow and ice was crusted the brush at the top, and this was only the beginning of October.

Mount Lafayette is one of the most popular hikes in the White Mountains because it provides some of the most incredible views, and can be completed in 6-7 hours. This makes it a family friendly hiking spot, compared to peaks like Mount Washington which are ideal for experienced hikers.  It was quite busy at the summit of Mount Lafayette, unsurprisingly since it was the perfect day for a hike.  

If I were to recommend a hike to someone who has never been to the White Mountains, I would recommend checking out this hike.  Be warned though it is difficult and is more strenuous than your average hike.  Bring plenty of snacks and water.  If you travel Old Briddle, there is a hut near the summit where you can stop and get something to eat and refill your water bottles.  If you pace yourself, you will have a fantastic time.
