# Mount Whiteface Hike

*September 21st, 2019*

Mount Whiteface is one of the many four thousand footers in the white mountains.  Located in Wonalancet New Hampshire, it lies in the Sandwich Mountain range.  Compared to other hikes I have completed in the white mountains, this hike stood out to me, particularly because of the location.  The Sandwhich Mountain range extends East to West for roughly 30 miles from Conway New Hampshire, to Campton.

The entrance of the trail head takes you through the backyards of town residents. The image above shows a section of the trail that runs through a private community.  Hikers are expected to be respectful of the land that they walk on.  The trails are very well kept and the land is protected.  Camping and all terrain vehciles are prohibited on these lands, and dogs must be kept on leashes.  Hikers in the White Mountains are usually very respectful of the land regardless if the land is protected or not.

The parking is about a half-mile from the trailhead.  The walk will take you through a quaint little community of people.  We happened to walk by some residents of the town on the way while they were tending to their homes and doing yardwork.  They were very friendly and open to hikers.

We took **Dicey's Mill** trail, then onto **Tom Wiggin**.  **Tom Wiggin** was the most difficult portion of the hike.  The incline was consistently steep and lasted for a little over a mile.  After **Tom Wiggin**, we turned right onto **Bluberry Ledge Trail**.  This trail was the most exciting and had the best views of the hike.  There were a few rock scrambles in this section.

Nearing the summit, there were a few rock lookouts where you could view parts of New Hampshire that are south of the white mountains.  One landmark that was visible was Lake Winnipesaukee way out in the distance.  It looked small from the summit of the mountain.
