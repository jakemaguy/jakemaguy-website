# Mount Whiteface Hike

*September 21st, 2019*

Mount Whiteface is one of the many four thousand footers in the white mountains.  Located in Wonalancet New Hampshire, it lies in the Sandwich Mountain range.  Compared to other hikes I have completed in the white mountains, this hike stood out to me, particularly because of the location.

The entrance of the trail head takes you through the backyards of town residents. The image above shows a section of the trail that runs through a private community.  Hikers are expected to be respectful of the land that they walk on.

We took **Dicey's Mill** trail, then onto **Tom Wiggin**.  Tom Wiggin was the most difficult portion of the hike.  The incline was consistently steep and lasted for a little over a mile.  After **Tom Wiggin**, we turned right onto **Bluberry Ledge Trail**.  This trail was the most exciting and had the best views.  There were a few rock scrambles in this section.

Nearing the summit, there were a few rock lookouts where you could view parts of New Hampshire that are south of the white mountains.  One landmark in particular that was visible was lake Winnipesaukee.
